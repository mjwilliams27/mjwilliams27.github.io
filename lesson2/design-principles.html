        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <p>Apple</p>
        <p>
            <a href="apple.com" target="_blank">apple.com</a>
        </p>
        <img src="images/apple.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of Apple Mobile Site">
        <p>Apple may be the king of using white space and clean design; in fact, all of their designs rely heavily on these two principles.
            This screenshot of their mobile site is no exception. The site is free from clutter and the background color is plain white.
            The text is basic black except for links to additional information. There is plenty of white space on the page for the eye to rest.
            There is no confusion on what the reader is supposed to focus on. </p>

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <p>Nike</p>
        <p>
            <a href="nike.com" target="_blank">nike.com</a>
        </p>
        <img src="images/nike.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of Nike Mobile Site">
        <p>On the Nike mobile website we see a simple, clean design. The black, bold and capital font contrasts with the white background 
            of the webpage. The same contrast is used in the photo of the shoe on display; a dark grey shoe with a light backdrop. 
            The contrast makes the text easy to read and the shoe easy to look at. The design of the page encourages the reader to shop and 
            purchase the item on display. 
        </p>

    <div class="part3">
        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        <p>Banana Republic</p>
        <p>
            <a href="bananarepublic.gap.com" target="_blank">bananarepublic.gap.com</a>
        </p>
        <img src="images/bananarepublic.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of Banana Republic Mobile Site">
        <p>The Banana Republic mobile website is much more similar to what the reader would see if using a tablet or desktop computer.
            It is clear this website has not been as customized for the mobile viewing experience and some others. However, the same font 
            type is used in nearly every section of text on the page, except the logo. The repetition helps the reader know they are on
            the same website and everything looks familiar. More important text is larger or bolder allowing the reader to follow the text
            from most important to least important.
